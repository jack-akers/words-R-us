# words-R-us

## User Story: 
AS A student,
I WANT to be able to easily search a word and find its definition and synonyms,
SO THAT I can expand my vocabulary and communicate more effectively in both written and spoken forms.

## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a dictionary web application with a search input,
WHEN I search for a word,
THEN I am presented with its definition and synonyms.
WHEN I refresh the page,
THEN I am able to learn a new random word of the day.
WHEN I view the search history,
THEN I am presented with a list of saved words from the previous word searches.

## Description
The Words R Us Application is a user-friendly tool designed to help students easily search for word definitions and synonyms. With a simple search input, users can quickly find the meaning and related words for any word they enter. The application also provides a "Random Word" feature to learn a new random word upon page refresh. Additionally, users can view their search history, allowing them to conveniently access previously searched words. The project aims to assist students in expanding their vocabulary and improving their written and spoken communication skills.

Overall, the development of the Words R Us Application allowed us to further refine our web development, API integration, user experience design, and data storage skills. By addressing the need for an efficient and user-friendly tool to support vocabulary expansion and effective communication, we hope to empower students in their language learning endeavors.
